## Preface

This is intended to be summary/quick-start guide to help others interested in the Cyrptocurrency boom learn more about what it is and how to get started. When I first started there were a lot of different forums and sites, but had a hard time findingone site that had all the information I needed to get started. Hope this helps others.

If there are any errors and you know how to use github, make a pull request.

## Crypto-Investing 101
1. Only put in what you are willing to lose - This market is extremely volatile and tends to be a zero-sum game. For every story you hear about Bitcoin making people millionaires overnight there is a story about someone putting his life savings and losing it all. Be careful.
2. Stay Focused - Don't let your emotions cloud your judgment and make the mistake of panic selling when the price drops or buying with the Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) of a lower price. The crypto market as it stands today is extremly volatile and not for the faint of heart. When the price rises, enjoy the ride or cash out. When the price drops, either buy more or go outside. 
3. Do Your Own Research - As of 7-Jan-2018 there are over 1,384 different cryptocurrencies and a large percent of these coins are scams. Go to the company's site (do they have a working site?), read the white-paper, understand its' mission and what/when/how it is they are trying to accomplish it.
4. Avoid coins that are not yet listed - ICOs (Inital Coin Offerings) are coins that offer a "promise". They have a website, idea, wand a whitepaper with a plan to bring the coin to market but never do - most recently seen by [Prodeum](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7tpifa/prodeum_ico_exitscams_with_millions_of_dollars). Granted not all ICOs are bad, I just reccomend avoiding them.

## Short & Quick Guide
In order to actually buy crypto-coins you need to do the following:
1. Join an exchange
2. Trade fiat (Dollars, Euros, etc) for crypto-coins
3. Move your coins to secure wallet

### Join an Exchange
For US based people I use the following:
1. **[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/)** - Coinbase is defiently one of the most user-friendly site & mobile apps I have seen. There fees are high, but the convience is great. Two things to note when putting your payment information in is that you can put both a credit/debit card and put your bank information. While the putting in your bank information allows for larger deposits, the transactions times are much longer (approx. 1 week) vs credit/debit (instantly)
2. **[GDAX](https://www.gdax.com/)** - GDAX is owned by Coinbase and there's really no difference except for the fact you can transfer coins from Coinbase to GDAX for FREE and then transfer from GDAX to another exchange (Binance) for less fees than if you were to transfer it directly from Coinbase to Binance
3. **[Binance](https://www.binance.com/)** - If you've seen the above 2 exchanges you'll notice they only offer 4 crypto-coins. Binance will allow you purchase 100s of other unique coins. 
4. Coming Soon: [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/referral/adamr520/) - Robinhood recently announced they would offer ZERO FEE crypto trading come February. Get on the list and make sure you use my referal code so we can both get [Free Stock](https://robinhood.com/referral/adamr520/)

These exchanges will ask you to upload ID, this is due to the "Know Your Client - KYC" laws. It is a standard form in the investment industry that ensures investment advisors know detailed information about their clients' risk tolerance, investment knowledge and financial position.

Certain exchanges are there to steal your personal information or rob you of your coins. I have a high confidence in the ones I've listed above and use them myself.

### Trade Fiat to Crypto
Once approved and verified by the exchanges you ready to buy some coins. 

Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are some of the biggest trading pairs (and easiest) in the market today. That is to say it is much easier to buy BTC or ETH with fiat than it is to buy VeChain (another crypto-coin) with fiat. I suggest buying ETH because of the lower fees and faster transaction times. 

So if you wanted to buy BTC, LTC, ETH you can just buy it on Coinbase and transfer it to your wallet and you would be set - see "Storing Your Coins"

If you wanted to buy other crypto-coins like Ripple (XRP) or VeChain (VEN) to name a few popular ones (yes, I own both) do the following:
**1. Buy ETH on Coinbase**
**2. Transfer ETH from Coinbase and GDAX**   
	1. Go to gdax.com/trade
   2. Choose the Deposit button at the top left. 
   3. Select the Coinbase Account tab.
   4. Choose a Coinbase wallet as your Source of funds.
   5. Enter the Amount of currency you would like to transfer.
   6. Select Deposit funds.
**3. Transfer ETH from GDAX to Binance**
   1. Go to gdax.com/trade
   2. Choose the Withdraw button at the top left.
   3. Select the ETH Address tab.
   4. Choose an amount of currency you wish to transfer to Binance - click 'max' if you want to transfer it all
   5. Go to https://www.binance.com/
   6. Choose the Funds button on the top left and click Deposits
   7. Type ETH on the left where it says 'Select Deposits Coin'
   8. Copy the ETH adress back to GDAX in the 'Destination' Field under ETH Address
   9. Complete the Two-Factor Authentication
   10. Select Withdraw funds - See Note
**4. Buy VEN or XRP**
   1. Go to https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=VEN_ETH
   2. Select the price in ETH in which you would like to buy VEN
   3. Select the amount (qty) of how many VEN you'd like to buy
   4. Choose Buy VEN

NOTE: It may take some time for the coins to show up in Binance wallet. You should be able to see the progress after a few minutes in the 'Transaction History' Tab under Funds in the top left corner in Binance

## Storing Your Coins
There are tons of horror stories where exchanges have been hacked and lost MILLIONS of cryptocurrencies. You're coins are vulnerable on exchanges. If you're doing small trades, it may not make sense to invest in hardware wallet, but if you plan on investing a significant amount of money and holding you're coins for awhile the reccomendation is to store them in hardware wallet like [Nano Ledger S](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/ledger-nano-s) or [Trezor](https://trezor.io/)
